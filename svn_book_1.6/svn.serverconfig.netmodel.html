      <p>At some point, you're going to need to understand how your Subversion client
communicates with its server.  Subversion's networking layer is abstracted,
meaning that Subversion clients exhibit the same general behaviors no matter
what sort of server they are operating against.  Whether speaking the HTTP
protocol (<code class="literal">http://</code>) with the Apache HTTP Server or
speaking the custom Subversion protocol (<code class="literal">svn://</code>) with
<span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, the basic network model is the same.  In this
section, we'll explain the basics of that network model, including how
Subversion manages authentication and authorization matters.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion client spends most of its time managing working copies.  When
it needs information from a remote repository, however, it makes a network
request, and the server responds with an appropriate answer.  The details of
the network protocol are hidden from the user—the client attempts to
access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a particular protocol is used
to contact the server (see <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.advanced.reposurls" title="2.3. 版本库的地址">第 2.3 节 “版本库的地址”</a>).</p>

        </div>
        <p>When the server process receives a client request, it often demands that the
client identify itself.  It issues an authentication challenge to the
client, and the client responds by providing
<em class="firstterm">credentials</em> back to the server.  Once authentication
is complete, the server responds with the original information that the
client asked for.  Notice that this system is different from systems such as
CVS, where the client preemptively offers credentials (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">logs
in</span>”</span>) to the server before ever making a request.  In Subversion, the
server <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pulls</span>”</span> credentials by challenging the client at the
appropriate moment, rather than the client <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pushing</span>”</span> them.
This makes certain operations more elegant.  For example, if a server is
configured to allow anyone in the world to read a repository, the server
will never issue an authentication challenge when a client attempts to
<span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>If the particular network requests issued by the client result in a new
revision being created in the repository (e.g., <span class="command"><strong>svn
commit</strong></span>), Subversion uses the authenticated username associated
with those requests as the author of the revision.  That is, the
authenticated user's name is stored as the value of the
<code class="literal">svn:author</code> property on the new revision (see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.properties.html" title="10. Subversion 属性">第 10 节 “Subversion 属性”</a>).  If the client was not authenticated (i.e.,
if the server never issued an authentication challenge), the revision's
<code class="literal">svn:author</code> property is empty.

        <p>Many Subversion servers are configured to require authentication.  Sometimes
anonymous read operations are allowed, while write operations must be
authenticated.  In other cases, reads and writes alike require
authentication.  Subversion's different server options understand different
authentication protocols, but from the user's point of view, authentication
typically boils down to usernames and passwords.  Subversion clients offer
several different ways to retrieve and store a user's authentication
credentials, from interactive prompting for usernames and passwords to
encrypted and non-encrypted on-disk data caches.</p>
        <p>The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately that there is reason
for concern here.  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Caching passwords on disk? That's terrible! You
should never do that!</span>”</span> Don't worry—it's not as bad as it
sounds.  The following sections discuss the various types of credential
caches that Subversion uses, when it uses them, and how to disable that
functionality in whole or in part.</p>

          <div class="titlepage">

          <p>Subversion offers a remedy for the annoyance caused when users are forced to
type their usernames and passwords over and over again.  By default,
whenever the command-line client successfully responds to a server's
authentication challenge, credentials are cached on disk and keyed on a
combination of the server's hostname, port, and authentication realm.  This
cache will then be automatically consulted in the future, avoiding the need
for the user to re-type his or her authentication credentials.  If seemingly
suitable credentials are not present in the cache, or if the cached
credentials ultimately fail to authenticate, the client will, by default,
fall back to prompting the user for the necessary information.</p>
          <p>The Subversion developers recognize that on-disk caches of authentication
credentials can be a security risk.  To offset this, Subversion works with
available mechanisms provided by the operating system and environment to try
to minimize the risk of leaking this information.</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>On Windows, the Subversion client stores passwords in the
<code class="filename">%APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/</code> directory.  On Windows 2000
and later, the standard Windows cryptography services are used to encrypt
the password on disk.  Because the encryption key is managed by Windows and
is tied to the user's own login credentials, only the user can decrypt the
cached password.  (Note that if the user's Windows account password is reset
by an administrator, all of the cached passwords become undecipherable.  The
Subversion client will behave as though they don't exist, prompting for
passwords when required.)</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores all repository
passwords in the login keyring (managed by the Keychain service), which is
protected by the user's account password.  User preference settings can
impose additional policies, such as requiring that the user's account
password be entered each time the Subversion password is used.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>For other Unix-like operating systems, no single standard
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">keychain</span>”</span> service exists.  However, the Subversion client
knows how to store passwords securely using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">GNOME Keyring</span>”</span>
and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">KDE Wallet</span>”</span> services.  Also, before storing unencrypted
passwords in the <code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code> caching area, the
Subversion client will ask the user for permission to do so.  Note that the
<code class="filename">auth/</code> caching area is still permission-protected so
that only the user (owner) can read data from it, not the world at large.
The operating system's own file permissions protect the passwords from other
non-administrative users on the same system, provided they have no direct
physical access to the storage media of the home directory, or backups
thereof.</p>

          <p>Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these mechanisms meets the test
of perfection.  So for those folks willing to sacrifice convenience for the
ultimate in security, Subversion provides various ways of disabling its
credentials caching system altogether.</p>

          <p>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you to authenticate,
by default Subversion tries to cache your authentication credentials on disk
in encrypted form.  On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt
your authentication data.  In those situations, Subversion will ask whether
you want to cache your credentials to disk in plaintext:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout https://host.example.com:443/svn/private-repo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION!  Your password for authentication realm:

   &lt;https://host.example.com:443&gt; Subversion Repository

can only be stored to disk unencrypted!  You are advised to configure
your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if
possible.  See the documentation for details.

You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value
of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in
'/tmp/servers'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Store password unencrypted (yes/no)? 
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>If you want the convenience of not having to continually reenter your
password for future operations, you can answer <code class="literal">yes</code> to
this prompt.  If you're concerned about caching your Subversion passwords in
plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and again, you can
disable caching of plaintext passwords either permanently, or on a
server-per-server basis.</p>

allow you to specify your username and password, respectively, so that
Subversion isn't forced to prompt you for that information.  This is
especially handy if you need to invoke Subversion from a script and cannot
rely on Subversion being able to locate valid cached credentials for you.
These options are also helpful when Subversion has already cached
authentication credentials for you, but you know they aren't the ones you
want it to use.  Perhaps several system users share a login to the system,
but each have distinct Subversion identities.  You can omit the
<code class="option">--password</code> option from this pair if you wish Subversion to
use only the provided username, but still prompt you for that username's

specifically regarding the <code class="option">--username</code> and
<code class="option">--password</code> options.  Many client subcommands accept these
options, but it is important to understand that using these options does
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automatically send credentials to the server.  As
discussed earlier, the server <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pulls</span>”</span> credentials from the
client when it deems necessary; the client cannot <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">push</span>”</span> them
at will.  If a username and/or password are passed as options, they will be
presented to the server only if the server requests them.  These options are
typically used to authenticate as a different user than Subversion would
have chosen by default (such as your system login name) or when trying to
avoid interactive prompting (such as when calling <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
from a script).</p>
